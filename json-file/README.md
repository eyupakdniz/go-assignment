# json-file
I performed JSON operations in Golang using the "io/ioutil" package. The "io/ioutil" package in Golang provides utilities for I/O operations, specifically for file handling. 
It simplifies the process of reading from and writing to files by offering convenient functions.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is used for data transmission between a server and a web application, or between different parts of a distributed system. It has become a popular format for representing structured data because of its simplicity, readability, and wide support across various programming languages and platforms.
