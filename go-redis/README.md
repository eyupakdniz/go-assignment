# go-redis-docker
I used Docker to send a JSON formatted file to Redis using Golang. I utilized the "github.com/redis/go-redis/v9" package for Redis interactions. The coordination between Dockerfile and docker-compose was established.

Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that is commonly used as a database, cache, and message broker. It is designed for high-performance data storage and retrieval, providing fast access to data by keeping it entirely in memory.

Docker is a containerization platform that enables the creation and management of lightweight, isolated containers.
